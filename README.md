Predicting bulldozer future price by given data using RandomForestRegression
### Guide

#### Problem Statement
For this dataset, the problem we're trying to solve, or better, the question we're trying to answer is,

How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

#### Data
1. Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
2. Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.*
3. Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.

How well can we predict future price, given past and present datas.

#### Evalation
The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
